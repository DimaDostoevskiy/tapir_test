# Workflow and Verification

- Use the correct project scripts:
  - `npm run dev` - run development server.
  - `npm run build` - create production build.
  - `npm run generate` - generate static output.
  - `npm run preview` - preview production output.
  - `npm run postinstall` - run Nuxt prepare step.
- After substantial code edits, run at least one relevant verification command (`build` or another task-specific check).
- If a command fails, fix introduced issues before finalizing or clearly report blockers.
- Do not leave partially implemented changes behind.
- In the final response, include what was changed, what was verified, and any remaining risks.
