# Core Quality Rules

- Solve the exact user request first; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing project patterns.
- Prefer type-safe solutions; avoid `any` unless clearly justified.
- Do not add dependencies unless they are necessary for the task.
- Do not change config or infrastructure files without explicit user request.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for a breaking change.
- Do not hardcode secrets, tokens, or environment-specific values.
- Reuse existing helpers/components before creating new abstractions.
- Remove temporary debug code before finishing.
- If behavior changes, document it in the final response with impact and risks.
