# Responsive UI First

- Treat responsiveness as a required quality bar for every UI change.
- Avoid hard fixed widths/heights for layout blocks when content can grow.
- Prefer fluid sizing (`%`, `min()`, `max()`, `clamp()`) and add breakpoints when needed.
- Ensure controls remain visible and clickable on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- For overlay/fixed elements, verify they are not hidden behind sticky/footer layers.
- Add or adjust media queries for components touched in the task.
- Keep typography and spacing readable on small screens.
- If a desktop-only element is added, hide or replace it on mobile intentionally.
