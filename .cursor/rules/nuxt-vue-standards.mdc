# Nuxt and Vue Standards

- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `script setup` in SFC components.
- Keep components focused: UI components should not own cross-page business logic.
- Use clear naming: components in PascalCase, composables/utilities in camelCase.
- Prefer Nuxt auto-imported primitives (`useRoute`, `useFetch`, `useState`) over custom wrappers unless needed.
- Keep page-level data loading in pages/composables, not in presentational components.
- Maintain SSR-safe code: guard browser-only APIs with client checks when required.
- Keep templates readable: extract repeated or complex markup into child components.
- Follow existing CSS/Sass conventions in the repo; avoid style-system rewrites in feature tasks.
